You will need to open the matlab file(.m) so you can insert the values of the circuit.The you can see the bode diagramm the transfer function and root locus diagram.Then
you can open the simulink programm that has a circuit with op-amps and RC elements and run the simulationto see the voltage output of a the system with step function as an input.
*Note: The RC values are the ones you inserted in the .m file
